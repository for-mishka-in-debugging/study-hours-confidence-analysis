# Study Hours and Confidence: A Regression Analysis

This project explores the relationship between study hours and studentsâ€™ confidence using Python.  

## Methods
- Simulated dataset with NumPy
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
- Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression with an instrumental variable

## Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, linearmodels, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and documentation

## Key Takeaways
- OLS suggests study hours predict confidence.
- IV regression corrects for bias by using library distance as an instrument.
- Demonstrates ability to code, analyze data, and interpret results.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/study-hours-confidence-analysis.git`
2. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install pandas statsmodels linearmodels matplotlib`
3. Run the notebook or Python script.
