# Study Hours and Confidence Analysis  

This project explores how study hours relate to confidence levels using simple regression models.  
It was created to practice data analysis and econometric methods in Python.  

**Whatâ€™s inside:**  
- A small dataset of study hours and confidence scores (simulated data)  
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using `statsmodels`  
- Instrumental Variables (2SLS) regression using `linearmodels`  
- Simple visualizations with `matplotlib`  

**Skills practiced:**  
- Importing and cleaning data with `pandas`    
- Running and interpreting regression models  
- Presenting results clearly in Python  

The code is written as a learning exercise and demonstrates my ability to work with data and econometric tools in Python.
